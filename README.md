# The Difficult problem that I faced:

   During my Data science training at Innomatics Research Lab, I got an project that is based on WEB SCRAPPING data from the websites and do analysis with that.
For this I choosed CARS24.com to scrap the data and tried lot to extract data but I can't able to retrieve the data. I understood that first I have to load the url which having all cars and then to find inner url which having the details of the car to extract it. After it tooks nearly a day to extract the data by understanding the situation. That was the problem I have struggled for and I finally got it.

# Subspace of V:
1.  for (a,a+1) for all a in R,
    closure:  a+a+1=2a+1 in R, because a is in R so 2a is in R and 2a+1 is also in R
    scalar:  a.(a+1)=a^2+a in R, because a^2 is in R.
    (a,a+1) is a subspace of v.
2.  for (a,b) for all a>=b,
    closure: let 2,1 then 2+1=3 is in R
    scalar:  let 1,1 then 1.1=1 is in R
    (a,b) is a subspace of v.
3.  for (a,2a) for all a in R,
    closure:  a+2a=3a is in R
    scalar:  a.2a=2a^2 is in R as a^2 is in R
    (a,2a) is a subspace of v.
4.  for (a,b) for all a is in positive R
    As above we can prove that this is also a subset of v.
 Therefore all are subsets of V.
